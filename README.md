# MIC-1 emulator and MAC-2 assembler

## Description

Implementation of the MIC-1 emulator and MAC-2 assembler, as specified in chapter 4 of Andrew S. Tanenbaum's _Structured Computer Organization_.

This was a project done in 2018 for my _Computer Architeture_ course at University.

The assembler, written in python, reads a .asm file, and generates a prog.exe file, which is read by the emulator. The file _microprog.rom_ was given by the professor, and most of the implementation of the emulator was taught by him.
